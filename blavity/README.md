# blavity-challenge

### Demo
[https://blavity.srcer.com](https://blavity.srcer.com)

### Technologies Used
`vue`, `vuex`, `sass`, `newsapi`, `express`, `mysql`, `axios`, `pm2`, `dotenv`

- Files used in backend API are contained in `server` directory, front end files in `src`, config file for backend is `ecosystem.config.js`

### Instructions
> Blavity Take-Home Assessment, due Wed. 5-6-20 by 4  ET
> Create a web-based application that:

> 1. Pulls news articles (any source is fine) in real-time using a news API, such as News API (newsapi.org )
> 2. Displays them (title and link) in a reactive list
> 3. Provides an option for each article allowing the user to save it for later (only the saving is necessary — no need to provide a view for revisiting saved articles)

> Pick whichever frameworks/tools/technologies you feel is best. For the saving part (#3), you should save the article’s title and link in a database system (any database system is okay, including cloud and browser-based options).

> Also, make sure that there is a README file for your application that tells us the approach you took, the frameworks/tools/technologies that you used, and how to build and run your application.

> There is no right or wrong process for reaching a solution to this coding exercise. As long as you satisfy all of the requirements listed above, you will successfully complete this exercise.

> Please send the link to your solution’s Github repository to coding-exercise@blavity.com.
